# OctoAcme Project Management — Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with a customer‑first, iterative mindset. Projects start with a lightweight Project One‑pager to validate the problem, stakeholders, and measurable success metrics, then move through explicit decision gates: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close &amp; Retrospective. This lifecycle keeps teams aligned on minimum artifacts required at each stage and ensures decisions are data‑informed and reversible when needed.

Work is organized around lightweight, repeatable workflows. Planning produces a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done; teams use timeboxed sprint or iteration planning to pull shippable increments. Execution is tracked on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and follows a pull request workflow encouraging small PRs, linked issues and acceptance criteria, automated CI checks, and at least one approval before merge. Risk capture and dependency marking are integrated into planning and weekly syncs so cross‑team blockers are visible early.

Roles and communication are explicit. Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Project Managers coordinate delivery and communications, Developers implement and test, QA validates acceptance, and stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Cadence includes daily standups for blockers and progress, weekly delivery syncs for updates and risks, regular demos at milestone ends, and monthly stakeholder updates; templates and escalation paths standardize reporting and triage.

Quality and release practices emphasize automation and deliberate manual checks. Teams rely on unit, integration, and end‑to‑end smoke tests, CI‑based linting and security scanning, and manual QA where required. Releases follow a checklist (staging smoke tests, rollback plans, release notes) with post‑deploy verifications and incident playbooks for rollback and triage. Continuous improvement is closed‑looped through timeboxed retrospectives that produce a small set of tracked action items added back into the backlog for follow‑up.
